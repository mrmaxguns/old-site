This is my first ever post. I'll write here from time to time, depending on
whether I'm busy. This is the place where I will describe and analyze various
subjects that I am familiar with.

This is my personal blog, and thus care should be taken when using any of the
information that I present. I will try my best to add sources when necessary,
although the best advice is to think for yourself.

My blog will slowly grow, but for now, you'll just have to wait.
