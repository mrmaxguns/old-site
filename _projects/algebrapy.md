# Integrating Algebra With Python
AlgebraPy is a python package in development that serves to allow programmers to include algebraic aspects such as data manipulation and representation with python. AlgebraPy's core units are the data objects that represent different types of data including numbers, variables and expressions. AlgebraPy is currently being developed and is in it's early pre-release stages. Some versions have been deployed to test pypi, but it isn't yet considered stable, and there is a lot of work to do. If you want to contribute or learn more, head over to [the AlgebraPy official website](https://algebrapy.github.io/).
