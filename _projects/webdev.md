# Web Development
I am not only a fan of python, but also developing websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All of these provide unique opportunities for me to learn and grow. The first site I ever made with HTML [can be found here](https://github.com/mrmaxguns/maximum). I later decided to look into bootstrap: I know use it a lot during site creation due to the fact that many of the code I originally wrote and keep repeating is covered by it.

# Flask
Recently, I have been working with flask to write backend with python, which allowed me to combine my skills of python with my skills of front-end design.
