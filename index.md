  ## Hi, I'm Maxim

You have come to the personal site of *mrmaxguns*, a.k.a. Maxim. Here, you'll
find all my projects, and my blog. I'm a student interested in programming,
science, mountain biking, and aviation. You can find my [blog here](blog/), or
you can learn more about me down below :)

## About me

I'm a hard-working student passionate about many topics. One of my interests is
software development. I have worked with Python, JavaScript, Godot (GDScript)
and HTML/CSS. I'm also interested in aviation. I recently acquired
[XPlane](https://x-plane.com), a flight simulator, which I recommend for anyone
interested in flying. I also enjoy reading about scienceâ€”specifically
mathematics and physics. Outside I like to mountain bike. I am proficient with
<span style="color:blue">**blue**</span> trails, and am moderately good at
some short <span style="color:black">**black**</span> segments.
